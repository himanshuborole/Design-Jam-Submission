    <p> <h1>What is Web Development?</h1><br>
       <h4>Web development refers to building, creating, and an maintaining websites.<br>
        It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming,<br>
        and database management.

        While the terms "web developer" and "web designer" are often used synonymously,<br>
        they do not mean the same thing. Technically, a web designer only designs website <br>
        interfaces using HTML and CSS. A web developer may be involved in designing a website,<br>
        but may also write web scripts in languages such as PHP and ASP. Additionally,<br>
        a web developer may help maintain and update a database used by a dynamic website.<br>
