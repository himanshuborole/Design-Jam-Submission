    <p> <h1><b>What is Cloud Computing?</b></h1><br>
       <h4> Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services <br>
        --from applications to storage and processing power -- typically over the<br>
        internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis.<br>
        In the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and<br>
        programs over the Internet instead of your computer’s hard drive. <br>
         A fundamental concept behind cloud computing is that the location of <br>
        the service, and many of the details such as the hardware or operating system on <br>
        which it is running, are largely irrelevant to the user. It's with this in mind <br>
        that the metaphor of the cloud was borrowed from old telecoms network schematics,<br>
        in which the public telephone network (and later the internet) was often represented <br>
        as a cloud to denote that the just didn't matter -- it was just a cloud of stuff.<br>
         This is an over-simplification of course; for many customers location of their<br>
          services and data remains a key issue.
